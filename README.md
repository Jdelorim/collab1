# collab1

## Concept

This is an experiment in using open source software development tools and methodologies for music collaboration.

## Rules

- Remember to pull down the latest tracks from Gitub before working on any changes locally.
- Feel free to modify existing tracks and add new tracks.
- Use whatever DAW or software that you want, but only commit rendered tracks. Do not commit your source/project files.
- Each track should be a single 16-bit FLAC of ~1 minute length.
- Maintain track length of ~1 minute to keep storage and bandwidth under control.
- When you are ready to submit your changes, push your code to GitHub and submit a pull request.
- Not all commits will be merged. As the "director" of this musical experiment, Bill ultimately decides which tracks are merged.
- In case of a conflict, only one of the conflicting tracks will be merged. (Audio diffs are not really possible at this point.)
- Have fun! :)

## Setup
